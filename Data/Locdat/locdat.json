I'm so touched,\nmy Manly Tears gauge is about to\nmax out!!! Anyway, just thought\nI'd write in to tell you about\nthe new update. (sniffle)\n \nPoint number 1: New expansion\nfor the Tower of Barbs!\n \nThey're finally gonna let us\nclimb up to 51F and beyond! But\nbe warned: it's gonna be\nhella freakin' hard, Senpai!\n \nPoint number 2:\nNew resources, new Mushrooms!\n \nThey've added two new resources:\nBloodnium and Death 'Roids.\nSupposedly, Bloodnium is this\nweird, unknown energy that came\nabout as a chemical reaction\nbetween high-level supercondensed\noxygen and enemy blood! As for\nDeath 'Roids, I'm told they're a\nnew type of powerful drug that\nyou can get somewhere on the\nnew floors!\n \nAlso, they've discovered a new\ntype of Mushroom called a\nSplattershroom. Eat it to get\nsome Bloodnium! Confused?\nYou and me both, pal! Just do me\na favor and eat a Splattershroom\nsometime when you get to 51F.\nThere are plenty of uses for it\nwhich I'll explain later on.\n \nOn to point number 3:\nUncapped Fighters!\n \nTake your stat-maxed Fighter\nover to Mingo Head and they'll\nget even stronger! Yep, they\nraised the limits! Apparently\nit'll cost you Bloodnium or\nDeath 'Roids to break the stat\ncaps, so just keep that in mind.\n \nPoint number 4:\nUncapped equipment, too!\n \nJust when you thought your gear\nhad reached its limits, now you\ncan upgrade it even further!!!\nFinally, you can power up that\nawesome-but-impractical armor!\nIt'll still cost you SPLithium\nand Materials, though.\nSorry about that!\n \nLastly, point number 5:\nBuff Effects!\n \nThere's a new Buff Effect at\nChoku-Funsha: Funshots!\nSupposedly it's a quantification\nof Kommodore Suzuki's gratitude,\nblah blah blah—look, it's a buff,\nalright? So go get buffed up\nsometime! He can even buff up\nrandom equipment, but he says\nit's a \"trade secret.\" What a\nBuffy McBufferson! (Whoops...\nI just really like saying\nthe word 'buff,' don't you?)\n \nAnyway, that's about it!\nTL;DR: lots of good stuff\nhappening!\n \n...Oh yeah, one more thing!\nYou can also trade Bloodnium for\ncertain Vending Machine items!\n \nOh, and there's gonna be a few\nBible updates:\n \n- Barb's Bible Vol.12\n\"Choku-Funsha\"\n- Barb's Bible Vol.13\n\"Vending Machine: Hernia\"\n- Barb's Bible Vol.25\n\"Mingo Head\"\n \nCatch you later!"
